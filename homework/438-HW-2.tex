This problem set will be submitted in two parts.  Part is written, which
can be submitted either on paper or electronically.  The homework will
be graded on how well you communicate your method much more than the
correctness of the result.  A correct result with no justification will
receive no credit.  I strongly suggest that you use diagrams where
appropriate and clearly state your assumptions.

The other part is a spreadsheet.  You will turn in a single spreadsheet
with multiple pages or sheets and share it with me on Google Docs using
my Seawolf account.  Please place all spreadsheets in a single file
named "Homework 2".  You can begin the spreadsheet in Excel on your own
computer and then upload it to Google Docs.  When you upload, please
convert the file to a Google Doc and make sure I have both read and
write permission.  This allows me to write feedback directly in the
spreadsheet and see your formulas.

\subproblem{REEPS2 Problem 1.3}

\solution{

The solution from the book misses the conversion from kgC to kgCO$_2$.
Each of these numbers should be multiplied by 44/12 (the conversion from
mass carbon to mass carbon dioxide) to get the added
carbon cost on the electricity.

\subproblem{REEPS2 Problem 1.11}


\solution{

The key to this problem is understanding when the coal plants are run
and what the average capacity factor means.  Since coal plants are
usually most economical when run constantly, the utility will try to
keep them on all the time.  If the load is 600MW or below, this utility
will only run coal plants.

For the capacity factor of the entire fleet of coal plants you have to
consider two quantities.  First, the amount of electrical energy created
by all the coal plants.  Second, the amount of electrical energy that
could have been created if all 600MW of the coal plants were run all
year long.  The ratio of these two numbers is the capacity factor.

\problem{Solar Levelized Cost}

Using your solar example from Homework 1.  If you finance the plant with
a 20-year loan at 5.0\%, what will your levelized cost of energy be?

Create a spreadsheet showing the cash flows over the 20 year life and
use it to make your calculation.  Remember, levelized cost of energy is
the total cost per year divided by the energy sold per year.

What will the levelized cost of electricity be if the solar farm can
generate and sell 1500 kWh for every kW installed?  1200 kWh? 1800 kWh?
You should be able to change one cell on your spreadsheet to find these
values.

\solution{

See the linked spreadsheet solution.

The key is to understand what fixed and variable costs we have for this
simplified solar plant.  The fixed cost is the yearly payment on the
loan while we ignore any variable costs in this example since sunlight
is available at no cost.  We then calculate the levelized cost by
dividing these costs by the amount of electrical energy we can generate
and sell.

My spreadsheet shows a cost of 0.14, 0.11, 0.09 USD per kWh for 1200,
1500, and 1800 kWh per year per kW installed.

You may notice that it is not necessary to show all 20 rows representing
20 years to do this calculation.  We will be using these in the future.
}


\problem{Diesel Levelized Cost}

In an off-grid village, diesel generators are often used.  We want to
calculate the cost of providing electricity using a diesel generator.
If our diesel genset costs \$500/kW and uses 0.35 liters of gasoline to
generate a kWh of electricity.  Assume a 10 year loan at 5.0\% interest.
Assume the generator runs for 6 hours each day.  Assume the generator is 5
kW and the village demand during the 6 hours is exactly 5 kW.

Create a spreadsheet showing the cash flows over the life of the plant
and make the levelized cost calculation.  Create a column for the
finance cost and the fuel cost.

Use your spreadsheet to calculate the electricity cost at \$0.75, \$1.0,
and \$1.25 per liter.  Also calculate the electricity cost for a 5kW and
10 kW generator.

Comment on anything you find interesting or surprising.


\solution{

See the linked spreadsheet solution.

Comments:

0.29, 0.38, 0.47 USD per kWh for 0.75, 1.00, and 1.25 USD per liter.

Because all the costs in our spreadsheet are proportional to the size of
the generator, you will not see any change in the cost of electricity
when you change the size of the generator.  In practice larger
diesel generators have better LCOE than smaller generators.


The diesel cost of electricity is over three times the price of the
solar electricity.  However, the diesel engine can be run at any time of
day or night, which is an advantage that may outweigh the cost benefit.
We did not include in the solar levelized cost the cost of batteries to
use electricity at night.
