## Shockley-Queisser limit
- Maximum single junction solar cell efficiency
- 33.7%

## Materials
- Silicon is not the only material
- Among many others:
- Cadmium Telluride (CdTe)
- Gallium Arsenide (GaAs)

## Questions
- How are a solar PV cell and a battery different?

## IV curves
- Whiteboard
- IV curve of battery
- IV curve of ideal voltage source
- IV curve of ideal current source
- IV curve of ideal resistor

## Solar cell
- A single pn junction

## PN junction

## Equivalent circuit model
- Current flows from p-type side through wire to n-type side
- Electrons flow from n-type side through wire to p-type side


<!-- Los, do installers hear these terms? -->

## Solar IV curve
- Combination of current source and diode
- Whiteboard

## Demonstration of internal diode
- Power supply, solar panel

<!--
hand out modules, ask how many cells in each
-->

## Maximum power point
- What is the value of the power at each point along the curve

## PV graphical determination
- Resistor PV curve intersection
