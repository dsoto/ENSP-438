## Review
- Units of radiation
- Calculation of incident radiation

## Radiation units
- Power per unit area (watts per square meter) (W/m$^2$)
- Power = Power per unit area $\times$ area
- Energy = Power $\times$ Time

## Atmospheric absorption
- Air mass ratio
- $I_B = Ae^{-km}$
- $I_B$ - insolation at earth's surface (W/m$^2$)
- $A$ - insolation in space (W/m$^2$)
- $k$ - optical depth (no units)
- $m$ - air mass ratio (no units)

## Angle of the sun and panel
- $I_{BC} = I_B \cos \theta$
- $I_B$ - insolation at earth's surface (W/m$^2$)
- $I_{BC}$ - insolation on collector (W/m$^2$)
- $\theta$ - no units
- $\cos \theta$ - no units

## Air mass ratio
- There are some standard air mass ratios we use
- AM0 is "in space"
- AM1 is for noon-day sun
- AM1.5 is the standard test condition that resembles year round
  insolation


## Photovoltaics

## Questions
- How are solar cells made?
- How do solar cells convert light to electricity?
- What affects the efficacy of solar panels?
- How are solar cells combined to create modules?
- What happens when solar cells are combined in arrays?
- How do solar cells and modules behave in electrical circuits?

## Solar installation
- Right now PV is seeing rapid growth
- 2013 California solar installations greater than last 30 years total

GTM Research

## Learning curves
![](../figures/learning_curve.png)

## Learning curves
- Each doubling of total number of watts of solar panels installed leads
  to a 10-20% reduction in costs

## Silicon wafer production
![](../figures/REEPS2CH5-czochralski.pdf)

- Same techniques as computer chips

## Semiconductors
- Conductors
- Insulators
- Semiconductors
- The properties of the electrons in these materials is what
  distinguishes them

## Electron bands
- Conduction band
- Insulating band
- Forbidden band

## Electron bands
![](../figures/REEPS2CH5-bands.pdf)

## Bandgap
- Photon must have at least 1.12 electron-volts of energy
- This corresponds to a wavelength of 1.1 microns
- Any photon with less energy creates no electron

## Collecting electrons
- Without collection method, any created electron will "fall" out of the
  conduction band before being used as electricity

## Semiconductor doping
- The addition of impurites (doping) changes the conductivity of silicon
- Impurities also affect the type of carrier
- Two types of charge carriers
    - electrons
    - holes (electron vacancies)

## PN junction
- Layering two types of doping (p and n) creates a PN junction
