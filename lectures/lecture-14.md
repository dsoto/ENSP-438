## Solar DC to AC conversion efficiency
- A panel is rated according to its peak DC output at standard test
  conditions (STC)
- From this ideal DC output, how much AC power is delivered?
- What are the power losses?
- We combine all these power losses into a single factor called a
  "derate"


## Derate Factors
![](../figures/REEPS2CH6-derate-table.pdf)

- REEPS2 Table 6.2

## Derate

$$ \eta_{overall} = \eta_{inverter} \eta_{mismatch} \cdots
\eta_{temperature} $$

## Derate calculator
- [NREL PVWATTS derate calculator](http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/calculators/pvwatts/version1/derate.cgi)
- Spreadsheet

## How much energy in a year?
- We multiply the rated DC power by the hours of peak sun each day by
  the number of days each year and then we add the derate factor.

$$ \textrm{AC Energy (kWh/yr)} = P_{DC-STC} \cdot PSH \cdot 365 \cdot derate $$

- PSH is peak sun hours
- $P_{DC-STC}$ is the DC power at standard test conditions

## How much DC power is needed?
- I want a PV solar system that provides 4000 kWh per year.  How many
  solar panels do I need?
- Written

## Taxes
- How are taxes calculated?
- How do energy investments affect the taxes we pay?

## Tax brackets
![](../figures/REEPS2CH6-tax-brackets.pdf)

## Marginal tax rates
- Written

## Tax deduction
- Tax deduction means you subtract the tax deduction amount from your
  income and then calculate your taxes
- Interest on loans is often allowed as a tax deduction
- How do we know how much we spent on interest?

## Example of loan and principal and interest
- Spreadsheet
