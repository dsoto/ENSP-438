## Questions
- What are the things that influence the cost of electricity?
- What is the cause of different prices at different times?
- What can you do to avoid peak prices?
- What can you do to avoid demand prices?
- Why do we have demand charges?

- How do we design systems to take advantage of these structures?

## How much electricity does an American home use?

From EIA:

In 2012, the average annual electricity consumption for a U.S.
residential utility customer was 10,837 kWh, an average of 903
kilowatthours (kWh) per month. Louisiana had the highest annual
consumption at 15,046 kWh and Maine the lowest at 6,367 kWh.

- Average about 30 kWh per day

## Tariff structures
- Inverted block structure
- Time of day structure
- Units of money per energy (USD/kWh)

## Demand charges
- Based on peak consumption
- Units of money per power per billing period (USD/kW/month)

## Tariff spreadsheet
- Normal rate
- Time of day rate
