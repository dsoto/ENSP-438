## Questions
- What wavelengths are important for solar energy?
- What wavelengths does the sun emit?
- What wavelengths does the atmosphere absorb?
- How do we measure the sunlight that strikes the earth?
- How does the angle of a solar panel affect the energy it collects?
- How do we estimate yearly and monthly solar energy in practice?

## Theory vs Practice
- I'll demonstrate mathematical expressions for solar radiation
- In practice you will use tables or software applications that
  calculate these values
- I want you to be able to go back in 10 years, pick up this book, and
  figure it out again.

## The journey of a photon
- Created in the core of the sun
- Millions of years to bounce out to surface of sun
- Zips to earth in about 8 minutes
- Passes through the atmosphere
- Strikes a solar panel and dislodges an electron in the PV panel
- Electron is collected and delivered to the grid

## Electromagnetic Spectrum

## Solar Spectrum
![](../figures/Solar_Spectrum.png)

## Spectrum
- Photovoltaic PV panels are wavelength specific
- PV panels do not convert all sunlight to electricity

## Extraterrestrial solar radiation
- Sunlight striking the top of the atmosphere

## Atmospheric absorption
- Air mass ratio
- $I_B = Ae^{-km}$
- sunlight striking earth equals the sunlight in space multiplied by a
  factor representing the atmosphere
- this factor depends on how clear the atmosphere is and how much
  atmosphere the light travels through

## Air mass ratio

## Angle of the sun and panel
- $I_{BC} = I_B \cos \theta$

## Angle of the sun and panel
We can determine the angle of the sunlight and the panel from the sun's
elevation and azimuth, and the tilt and angle of the panel.

## Components of solar radiation
- Direct
- Reflected
- Diffuse

## Direct, reflected, diffuse
![](../figures/REEPS2CH4-direct-and-reflected.pdf)

## Tilt for maximum direct sun
- What angle is best to angle your panel?
- How do we express this mathematically?
- We want to aim panel directly at the sun
- Cheapest to aim panel in fixed direction

## Tilt for maximum diffuse
- Horizontal to collect from "all" the sky

## Relative contributions
- Diffuse about 15% of total horizontal
- Reflected usually less than diffuse

## Tracking
- Tracking systems follow the sun throughout the day allowing for better
  collection of direct sun

## Radiation measurements
- We've seen how to calculate radiation
- How do we measure it?

## Historical radiation data

## Typical meteorological year
- Hourly solar and weather estimates for typical conditions
- Based on historical data

## Typical meteorological year
[NREL TMY3](http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/old_data/nsrdb/1991-2005/tmy3/)

## TMY Station Locations

## TMY quantities
- Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI)
- Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI)
- Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DHI)
