## Quiz

<!--
TODO
- grab relevant figures
- pull in figures from gil lectures
-->

## Questions we will be able to answer
- Where is the sun at any time?
- How much radiation does it produce?
- Where do I put solar panels?
- Will my solar panels be blocked by trees or homes?
- Which direction should they face?
- How much will they produce now? this month?  this year?

## Questions for class
- What causes the seasons?
- What time of day is the sun highest in the sky?
- What time of year is the sun highest in the sky?
- How do we specify the position of the sun?
- How do we specify our position on earth?
- Where are we in our orbit?
- Where does the sun rise?
- Where does the sun set?

## The Solar System

## Seasons
- What causes the seasons?

## Seasons
- Earth axis of rotation is tilted with respect to the orbital or
  ecliptic plane

## Earth orientation and orbit

where is the northern hemisphere's winter?
where is the southern hemisphere's winter?

## Earth sun distance
$d=1.5 10^8 (1 + 0.017 sin(360(n-93)/365))km$

- Is this close to circular?

## Solar declination
- Measures the elevation of the sun relative to the earth's equitorial
  plane
- From the earth's perspective, the sun exhibits a sinsusoidal up and
  down motion with a period of one year.

## Solar declination
![](../figures/REEPS2CH4-declination.pdf)


## Declination equation
We can estimate the declination of the sun with this equation

$23.5 \sin\left(\frac{2\pi(n-81)}{365}\right)$

- n is the day of the year

## Declination plot
- (nbviewer)

## Solar position
- How many angles do we need to specify sun position
- Elevation
- Azimuth

## Hour angle
- Angle of earth rotation with respect to solar noon

## Elevation
$\sin\beta = \cos L \cos \delta \cos H + \sin L \sin \delta$

## Azimuth
$\sin \phi = \cos \delta \sin H / \cos \beta$

## Exercise
Calculate the elevation and azimuth we expect for the sun right now here
at Sonoma State.

## Sun elevation and azimuth measurement
- Measure sun angles (weather permitting)
- Read inverter outputs
