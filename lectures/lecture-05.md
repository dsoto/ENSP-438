## Questions from reading

## Questions
- How do utilities determine the price of electricity?
- How do utilities determine where to buy their power?
- How do small-scale sources value their electricity?

<!--
the basics apply, how much does it cost to generate in total, how much
can you sell at that rate?
-->

## Levelized cost of electricity (LCOE)
- Fixed costs
    - Do not change with amount of electricity sold
- Variable costs
    - Are proportional to amount of electricity sold

## LCOE

$$ \textrm{LCOE (\$/kWh)}
   = \frac{\textrm{Annual fixed cost} +
           \textrm{Annual variable cost}}
          {\textrm{Annual electricity output}} $$

<!--
what are examples of fixed costs
variable costs?
-->

## Fixed cost
- Annualized cost to build plant
- Salary of workers
- Insurance



<!--
extend to other business ideas
- taxi, car cost, fuel cost
- solar lantern
-->

## Variable cost
- Cost of fuel
- Maintenance
- cost/kwh = cost/btu * btu/kwh

## Heat rate
- Energy of fuel per unit of electricity output
- Quantifies the thermal efficiency of the plant

## Levelized cost
- An equivalent cash flow stream with equal payments each year
