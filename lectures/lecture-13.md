## Designing a PV system
- Design is an art
- What are your goals?
- What factors matter?

<!--
# name some goals
- saving money
- lowering carbon
- appearing green

# name some factors
- daily energy
- peak energy
- available panel location
- available panel area
- local financial incentives
-->

## Types of PV systems
- Grid tied vs. off-grid
- Behind the meter vs. utility

## Grid Tied
- Power can be supplied by either a PV system or the grid

## Off-Grid
- There is no grid to rely on for backup
- Must have storage
- Possibility for blackout in cloudy weather or high use

## Behind the meter
- A customer who generally only purchases retail power also becomes a power generator

## Utility
- Systems meant to sell power into the wholesale market on the grid

## Retail vs Wholesale
- Wholesale
    - In California, organised by California Independent System Operator
      (CAISO)
    - Priced in USD per megawatt hour
- Retail
    - What the customer pays
    - Priced in USD per kilowatt hour

## PV block diagram

## PV supply and consumer demand

<!--
sketch out what you think your power demand is at home
sketch out what you think a solar panel will produce

## Supply and Demand
![](../figures/REEPS2CH6-supply-demand.pdf)

## Single meter system
![](../figures/REEPS2CH6-net-metering.pdf)

## One meter
- What can we observe if we have one meter?
- We can only see the difference between PV generation and grid use
- This is net metering

## Two meter system
![](../figures/REEPS2CH6-dual-meter.pdf)

## Two meters
- What can we observe if we have two meters?
- We can see the absolute amounts as well
- For Feed-In-Tariff, we need two meters

## What about a digital or smart meter
- Observe time of day
- Keep high frequency records

## PV supply and consumer demand
- Whiteboard

## PV averages


## PV averages
- Estimations are made simpler by taking daily or monthly averages
- Peak sun hours
- Derating

## Peak sun hours
- Whiteboard





## Derate factor (overall)
- Allows us to simplify losses and efficiencies

## Overall derate factor
- How do we go from derate factors that change hourly to an average?
