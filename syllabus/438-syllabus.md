## Course Description

Course will focus on functional design of small-scale wind,
photovoltaic, biomass, and hydroelectric energy sources. Siting,
evaluating potentially available power, design of fully operable
installation, and by-products and waste streams will be discussed.
Energy storage mechanisms, interconnections to existing energy networks,
and energy cost comparisons will be examined. Prerequisite: ENSP 338,
ENSP majors, junior- or senior-level standing, or consent of instructor.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand science and economics of renewable electricity sources
- Perform detailed calculations of energy production and economic value
  of renewable energy sources

## Course Requirements

This course assumes a solid background in algebra, trigonometric
functions, and physics.  There will be at least six homework assignments
that will have both quantitative and qualitative tasks.  Students should
come to class having completed the assigned reading and be ready to
perform guided problem solving during class.  Students will complete a
project at the end of the class and give a written report and
presentation that integrates what they have learned in the class.

## Grading

- Classroom work (quizzes, participation) 25%
- Homework 50%
- Research project 25%


## Agreements

- Respectful tone in classroom

Civility is required from all students during discussions and
interactions.  In general, I expect students to be supportive of each
others learning goals.

- Minimize electronic distractions

Internet-connected electronic devices (phones, tablets) may be used in
class for learning purposes.  Using devices for social networks or other
uses during class time is strongly discouraged.


## Required Texts

Gil Masters, *Renewable and Efficient Electric Power Systems*, 2nd
Edition.  Available at the Campus Bookstore and at Northlight Books.
There is also an online version of the text available on the Sonoma
Library website.

Other readings will be posted online to Moodle.
