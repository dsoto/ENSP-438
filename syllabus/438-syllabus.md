## Course Description

Course will focus on functional design of small-scale wind,
photovoltaic, biomass, and hydroelectric energy sources. Siting,
evaluating potentially available power, design of fully operable
installation, and by-products and waste streams will be discussed.
Energy storage mechanisms, interconnections to existing energy networks,
and energy cost comparisons will be examined. Prerequisite: ENSP 338,
ENSP majors, junior- or senior-level standing, or consent of instructor.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand science and economics of renewable electricity sources
- Perform detailed calculations of energy production and economic value
  of renewable energy sources
- Communicate quantitative aspects of electricity generation

## Course Requirements

This course assumes a solid background in algebra, trigonometric
functions, and physics.  There will be at least six homework assignments
that will have both quantitative and qualitative tasks.  Students should
come to class having completed the assigned reading and be ready to
perform guided problem solving during class.  Students will complete a
project at the end of the class and give a written report and
presentation that integrates what they have learned in the class.

## Grading

- Classroom work (quizzes, participation) 25%
- Homework 50%
- Research project 25%


## Agreements

- Respectful tone in classroom

Civility is required from all students during discussions and
interactions.  In general, I expect students to be supportive of each
others learning goals.

- Minimize electronic distractions

Internet-connected electronic devices (phones, tablets) may be used in
class for learning purposes.  Using devices for social networks or other
uses during class time is strongly discouraged.

## Homework

You will be graded both on the
validity of your work as well as your ability to communicate your
methods.  This means that in addition to the mathematics, you should be
providing brief explanations of your techniques and your thought
process.  Calculations without supporting arguments will not receive
full credit.

Homework will be graded on a coarse grading schedule of a 1, 2, or 3.  A
3 is given for strong work that meets or exceeds the requirements, a 2
for adequate work, and a 1 for work that doesn't meet expectations.
After grading, you may submit a self-evaluation that considers how your
approach differs from the accepted approach.  Self-evaluations that
demonstrate an improvement in your understanding will raise your
homework grade through partial credit.


Here is the tentative homework schedule.

| Date      | Homework     |

| Thu 01-16 | Homework 0   |
| Tue 02-11 | Homework 1   |

## Classroom Work

We will solve problems in class that I hand out.  These are graded
credit no credit.  If you have an unexcused absence on that day, you
will receive a no credit grade for that days work.

## Office Hours

My office hours are held Tuesday and Wednesday in my office in Rachel
Carson Hall 12 from 2pm until 3pm.  Signup is online and can be accessed
