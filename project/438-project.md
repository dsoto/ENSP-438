# ENSP 438 Final Project

This project is an opportunity for you to more deeply explore a
small-scale project that is of interest to you.  You have freedom in the
selection of your topic.  My main criteria are that

1. The project is interesting to you
2. You provide a rigorous quantitative analysis
3. You provide a clear explanation of your work

Many of you will be doing this sort of work throughout your careers and
I want to give you practice in this.

We will pursue this project in multiple steps including a brainstorming
phase, a proposal, a rough draft, a final draft, and a presentation.
This is to simulate the way work is often done in professional settings.
I'm hoping that this project and what you learned can be a topic of
discussion in your job interviews in your near future.




## Brainstorm topic

Brainstorm a list of possible topics on your own.
This is to get you thinking.

## Choose topic

<!-- Due 04 March 2014-->

Settle on a topic and specific questions you want to answer in the
course of your research.

## Proposal

<!-- Due XX March 2014 -->

After you have settled on a topic, you will compose a short proposal
for the research.  Proposals are written to obtain funding and resources
for projects.  In this case, you are explaining what your model will
calculate and why it is useful.

The proposal will be a one-page typed document that clearly states:

1. The objective of the calculation and analysis
2. The proposed method of calculations including inputs and outputs

Clearly state the inputs to your model and what the model will answer.
For example, you may be able to enter the cost of panels and the tilt of
panels and calculate the amount of water pumped each day in a typical
meteorological year.



## Peer feedback on proposal


Proposals are circulated to the people who will decide if the project is
promising.  If so, the proposal can be funded and go forward.

To simulate this process, your proposal will be randomly assigned to two
peers to read and comment.

Your peers will comment on the following questions

1. How can the objective be made more clear?
1. How can the method of calculation be made more clear?
1. What would you add to the calculation to make it more complete?
1. Will the method of calculation provide the answers stated in the
objective?

Each of you will read the work of two of your peers.  You will provide a
response to each of these questions for each of your peers.  These will
be submitted on Moodle and distributed to your peers.

Make your feedback supportive, constructive and keep it focused on the
proposal.  As a rule of thumb, provide comments only on the work, not
the person.  Your goal is to help your classmates improve the quality of
their projects and reach their highest potential.


### Submission

Communicate your written feedback to your classmates however you like.
You will submit a copy of your feedback, in PDF format, on Moodle.
Indicate the name of the feedback recipient and the comments.

## Turn in first draft

<!-- Due 27 Mar 2014 -->

You will turn in a first draft of your proposal.  This first draft will
contain a report explaining your calculation and analysis and the
spreadsheet calculation itself.

This report will contain a written part with an introduction, a
description of your methods, a summary of your results, and a discussion
of the implications of your result.  You will also include either in the
text or as an appendix, the details of your calculations.  The written
portion should be at least 1000 words in length.

The report will be submitted via moodle as a single PDF file.


Unexcused late submissions will lose 10 points for each day they are
late.

## First draft feedback

In professional
environments, any work you do will be submitted for review and revision.
We will simulate this by sending it to the same peer reviewers that read
your proposal.  They will read it and give you feedback on

<!-- these cannot be yes and no questions -->

1. Is the report well structured and does it contain an introduction,
   method description, and discussion of implications?
1. How can the spreadsheet calculations be made more clear?
1. How can the explanation of the calculations be made more clear?
1. Are there any mistakes in the calculation?

If you don't have any suggestions for improvement, you must point out
which aspects of the project are strongest and why.


### Submission

You will have the same feedback partners as you had for the proposal.
Communicate your written feedback to your classmates however you like.
You will also submit a copy of your written feedback to your classmates, in
PDF format, on Moodle.  Indicate the name of the feedback recipients in
the comments.


## Final report


You will turn in a single PDF file with your report, and spreadsheet
outputs.

The final report will incorporate the feedback from the peer reading.

Unexcused late submissions will lose 10 points for each day they are
late.

## Final Presentation


You will present your work in class explaining your topic, your
analysis, and your results.

## Groups

You may work in groups of two if you like.  Your group must be decided
by the time you submit the proposal.
